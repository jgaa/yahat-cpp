Yet Another HTTP API Thing - A trivial HTTP server for simple REST API's and other HTTP interfaces in C++ projects

This project contains a very simple HTTP server-as-a-library to make it simple
to embed a HTTP/REST API in a C++ project. In recent years, I have found
myself re-inventing this wheel a little to frequently when I have
creates micro-services or other C++ project that required a HTTP interface. 

## Platforms
Currently tested only with Linux and boost 1.81. Uses boost.asio and boost.beast

Uses C++17.

## Status
Pre-beta.
